# Swagger documentation demo

This project shows how to tune the documentation. This is an extended version of
the [previous minimalistic example](../02-minimalistic-springdoc).

Note: one thing that is changed here is the Swagger UI URL, see below! 

To see the documentation use the following URLs:

* For JSON-format documentation: [http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs](http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs)
* For a user-friendly documentation
  browser: [http://localhost:8080/api-docs](http://localhost:8080/api-docs)

This example is used in the course [IDATA2306 Application Development](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/IDATA2306)
