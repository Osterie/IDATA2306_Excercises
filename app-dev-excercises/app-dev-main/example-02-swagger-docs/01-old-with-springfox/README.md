# Outdated Swagger example using Springfox

**Do NOT use this code!** This project shows how to auto-generate OpenAPI-compatible documentation
with Swagger UI using the Springfox library. The library is not maintained. You should use other
libraries, such as Springdoc. See [`02-minimalistic-springdoc`](../02-minimalistic-springdoc).

This example is used in the
course [IDATA2306 Application Development](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/IDATA2306)
