# Example of accessing .env files

A project showing how you can store environment variables in an `.env` file and access those in your
Spring Boot project.

You can see the values by opening `http://localhost:8080` in the browser.

Note: in real projects the `.env` file would be added to `.gitignore` and not stored in the GIT
repository. Here we store it only for demo purposes.
