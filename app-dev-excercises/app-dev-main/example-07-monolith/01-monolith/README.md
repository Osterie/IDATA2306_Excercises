# Library website variant - server-side rendered monolith

A monolithic Spring-Boot application serving static, server-rendered HTML pages. All the data is
selected on the server and injected directly before returning the HTTP response. Thymeleaf templates
are used.

This is one variation of the library application, see the [idea description](..).
