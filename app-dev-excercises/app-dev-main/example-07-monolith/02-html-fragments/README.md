# Library website variant - HTML fragments

A static site is loaded first, then Javascript handles clicks, requests content from the server,
gets pre-rendered content as static HTML chunks. These chunks are then placed inside the existing
DOM.

This is one variation of the library application, see the [idea description](..).
