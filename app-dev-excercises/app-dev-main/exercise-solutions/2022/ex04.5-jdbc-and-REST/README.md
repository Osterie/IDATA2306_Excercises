# Solution for 4.5

This is a solution for exercise 4.5 used in the
course [IDATA2306 Application development](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/IDATA2306)
at [NTNU](https://ntnu.edu).

This project is an extension of [exercise 4.4](../ex04.4-retrieve-borrowers)

NB: The solution is first created in an "incorrect way" - by simply using
the [JdbcConnection](src/main/java/no/ntnu/JdbcConnection.java) as an external class. 
Afterwards, we integrate it in the Spring-Boot's-way.

## Tests
You can import the [test collection](ex4.5_postman_tests.json) into Postman to test your API endpoints.
