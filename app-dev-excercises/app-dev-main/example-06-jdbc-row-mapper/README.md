# Database access with RowMapper

This is an example showing how to use RowMapper for converting SQL ResultSet to an object of your
own model class.

Most of the code is essentially copied from the [previous example](../example-05-jdbc-db-access),
only the RowMapper part is new.

The application assumes that you have created a database with necessary tables. To do that, execute
the SQL statements provided in the file `library-db-schema.sql`.
