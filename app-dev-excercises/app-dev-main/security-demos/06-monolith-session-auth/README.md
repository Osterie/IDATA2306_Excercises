# Security example #6: Full-stack monolith Spring Boot application with session authentication

This is the 6th example in the series on Spring Security.

It is based on [Example #4](../04-jpa-authentication) with the following modifications:

1. Thymeleaf used to render simple pages (Spring MVC controllers, no REST controllers)
2. Links between pages added
3. Logout added
4. Sign-up added
5. Styling of login form
6. Example on how we can also include asynchronous Javascript requests which loads some data from
   the frontend (where authorization is needed).
7. Examples on how user can change some data in the database (update his/her bio)
